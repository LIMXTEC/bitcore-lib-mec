Bitcore MegaCoin Library
=======

A pure and powerful JavaScript MegaCoin (MEC) library.

## Principles

MegaCoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the MegaCoin network allows for highly resilient MegaCoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement MegaCoin apps and services.

## Get Started

```
git clone https://github.com/LIMXTEC/bitcore-lib-mec.git
cd bitcore-lib-mec
npm install
```


## Documentation

The complete docs are hosted here: [bitcore documentation](http://bitcore.io/guide/). There's also a [bitcore API reference](http://bitcore.io/api/) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, where you'll find low-level details on each bitcore utility.

## Security

We're using Bitcore in production, as are [many others](http://bitcore.io#projects), but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.

If you find a security issue, please email security@bitpay.com.

## Building the Browser Bundle

To build a bitcore-lib full bundle for the browser:

```sh
gulp browser
```

This will generate files named `bitcore-lib-mec.js` and `bitcore-lib-mec.min.js`.

You can also use our pre-generated files

## Development & Tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LIMXTEC/bitcore-lib-mec
cd bitcore-lib-mec
npm install
```

Run all the tests:

```sh
gulp test
```

You can also run just the Node.js tests with `gulp test:node`, just the browser tests with `gulp test:browser`
or create a test coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it) with `gulp coverage`.
